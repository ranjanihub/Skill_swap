# Connection Page Feature

## Overview
The Connection Page feature allows users to manage their active and pending relationships with other users. This includes viewing a list of connections, filtering and sorting them, and accessing detailed information about each connection.

## Features
- **Connection List**: A scrollable list displaying connection cards with profile photos, names, connection types, and status badges.
- **Connection Detail View**: Detailed information about a selected connection, including profile preview, skills exchanged, session history, and chat history.
- **Status Types**: Different statuses for connections (e.g., active, pending) to help users manage their relationships effectively.
- **Quick Actions**: Buttons for messaging, viewing profiles, and rescheduling sessions for each connection.
- **Filters and Sorting**: Options to filter connections by learning/teaching status, connection status, and skill category, as well as sorting by recent activity or alphabetically.
- **Empty States**: User-friendly messages and call-to-action prompts when there are no connections available.

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Filtering Options**: More granular filters based on user preferences and connection history.
- **Notifications**: Alerts for new connection requests or updates on existing connections.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Insights into connection patterns and engagement metrics.
